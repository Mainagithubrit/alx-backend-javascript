                    # 0x01. ES6 Promises

- In this project we are looking at Promises in Javascript and how it works. We have Eleven Tasks which include:

    - 0. Keep every promise you make and only make promises you can keep            - Return a Promise using this prototype function getResponseFromAPI()

    - 1. Don't make a promise...if you know you can't keep it
            - Using the prototype below, return a promise. The parameter is a boolean.
                - When the argument is:
                            - true
                                 - resolve the promise by passing an object with 2 attributes:
                                        - status: 200
                                        - body: 'Success'
                            - false
                                - reject the promise with an error object with the message The fake API is not working currently
